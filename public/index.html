<h1>My Liminal Space - Direct Site Asset Access and (basic) AWS Cognito Integration</h1>
<p>Hello, this site provides a showcase for two simple libraries intended to aid building interactive web sites using Cloudflare Workers Sites.</p>
<ul>
    <li>@my-liminal-space/cw-site-assets (<a href="https://github.com/my-liminal-space/cw-site-assets">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@my-liminal-space/cw-site-assets">npm</a>) - fetch a site asset from the site KV instance by its path (allowing greater programmatic control over
        which "asset" (a file in the "public" folder) is served in response to a request</li>
    <li>@my-liminal-space/cw-validate-cognito-jwt (<a href="https://github.com/my-liminal-space/cw-validate-cognito-jwt">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@my-liminal-space/cw-validate-cognito-jwt">npm</a>) - validate an AWS Cognito generated JWT using a PEM cached in KV</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/my-liminal-space/cw-cognito-implicit-demo">GitHub repo</a> for this site includes a basic (but functional) integration with AWS Cognito using the Cognito provided Login UI.
The worker checks to see if the requested path starts with "/req-auth8", if it does then a valid JWT needs to be available in a cookie
called "AUTH8JWT".</p>
<p>If no such cookie is available or the contents of the cookie is not a valid JWT (determined using @my-liminal-space/cw-validate-cognito-jwt), 
a "redirect" page is served back to the client rather than the requested page (read from the site KV using @my-liminal-space/cw-site-assets).</p>
<p>The redirect page uses client side JavaScript to direct the browser to the Cognito Login UI. Another page uses client side JavaScript to 
receive the response from Cognito and a final page uses client side JavaScript to forward the user to the page they originally requested.</p>
<p>While this approach "works" it is a "proof of concept", only suitable for simple cases where a basic login is all that is required. A better
approach would be to go "full OAuth", which (potentially) avoids:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sharing the "real" JWT with the client (reducing the need to trust the client)</li>
    <li>Relying on the client having JavaScript enabled</li>
    <li>Having all the redirects in the browser history (which messes up the "back button" behaviour)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also worth noting that the implementation does not yet handle all potential error cases...</p>
<p>The links below drive the demo. <em>NOTE:</em> in order to be able to log in, you will need to use the links on the Cognito login page to 
create your own account (the email address you provide will not be shared with anyone/anything!).</p>
